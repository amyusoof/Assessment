You need a solution that allows an adapter to receive messages from a JMS queue, refine them, and then dynamically route them to either an on-premise or cloud-based REST API for payment, based on rules involving bank name and payment type.

Here's a design and a simple diagram to address this:

Design for Dynamic Payment Routing
1. Components
JMS Queue (Input): This is where raw payment messages arrive.

Payment Adapter: This component is responsible for:

Consuming messages from the JMS Queue.

Refining/transforming the message payload into a format suitable for the payment APIs.

Implementing the routing logic.

Invoking the appropriate payment REST API (on-premise or cloud).

Configuration Store: A central place to store the routing rules (e.g., a database, configuration file, or a dedicated configuration service).

On-Premise Payment REST API: The existing payment processing endpoint.

Cloud Payment REST API: The newly migrated payment processing endpoint.

Error Handling/DLQ (Dead Letter Queue): For messages that fail processing or routing.

2. Design Principles
Loose Coupling: The adapter should be decoupled from the specifics of the payment APIs.

Configurability: Routing rules should be easily modifiable without code changes.

Scalability: The adapter should be able to handle increasing message volumes.

Resilience: Mechanisms for retries, error handling, and fallback should be in place.

3. Routing Logic Details
The core of this design is the routing logic within the Payment Adapter. Here's how it would work:

Message Consumption: The Payment Adapter continuously polls or subscribes to the JMS Queue for new messages.

Message Refinement: Once a message is received, the adapter performs necessary transformations, validations, and enrichments. This might involve parsing the message, extracting key fields like bankName and paymentType, and converting it into a standardized internal format.

Rule Evaluation:

The adapter retrieves the bankName and paymentType from the refined message.

It then consults the Configuration Store to find a matching rule.

Example Rules (in Configuration Store):

Rule 1: If bankName = "BankA" AND paymentType = "Credit Card" 
rightarrow Route to On-Premise API

Rule 2: If bankName = "BankB" AND paymentType = "ACH" 
rightarrow Route to Cloud API

Rule 3: If bankName = "BankC" 
rightarrow Route to Cloud API (default for BankC)

Rule 4: Default (if no other rule matches) 
rightarrow Route to Cloud API (or On-Premise, based on your overall strategy)

API Invocation: Based on the evaluated rule, the adapter dynamically selects and invokes the appropriate REST API endpoint (either on-premise or cloud).

Response Handling: The adapter receives the response from the payment API, logs it, and potentially sends a confirmation or status update to another queue/service.

Error Handling:

If the routing fails (e.g., no rule matches, invalid data), or the API invocation fails (network error, API error response), the message should be directed to an Error Handling/DLQ for manual inspection or retry.

Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient API errors.

4. Technology Considerations
Payment Adapter: Can be implemented using various technologies:

Spring Boot: Excellent for building REST clients, JMS consumers, and managing configuration.

Apache Camel: A powerful integration framework specifically designed for routing and mediation. It provides excellent support for JMS and HTTP.

Node.js/Python: For simpler adapters, if preferred.

Configuration Store:

Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL): For dynamic, easily modifiable rules.

Configuration Files (e.g., YAML, JSON): Simpler for static or less frequently changing rules. Can be managed by Spring Cloud Config Server or similar.

Key-Value Store (e.g., Redis, Consul): For high-performance rule lookups.

JMS Provider: ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Kafka (if using Kafka for messaging).

5. Benefits of this Design
Flexibility: Easily add, modify, or remove routing rules without code changes.

Controlled Migration: Allows for a phased migration to the cloud, routing specific banks or payment types first.

Reduced Risk: Minimizes the impact of the migration on existing on-premise systems.

Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns between message processing and routing logic.

Explanation of Diagram:

JMS Queue: The starting point for payment messages.

Payment Adapter: The core component that handles message consumption, refinement, and routing.

Message Refinement: Internal process within the adapter to prepare the message.

Rule Evaluation: Where the decision about routing is made based on the refined message.

Configuration Store: Provides the rules for the Rule Evaluation.

On-Premise Payment REST API: The target for some payments.

Cloud Payment REST API: The target for other payments.

Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): Where messages are sent if there's a processing or routing error.

This design provides a robust and flexible solution for your dynamic payment routing needs, allowing you to gradually migrate to the cloud while maintaining connectivity to your on-premise systems.
